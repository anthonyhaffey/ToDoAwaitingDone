Check ""Post-Thesis"" folder in Thesis; to look at the effect of valence on which images the participants performed best in during the Go/No-Go, compare the D-Prime scores for the two most used rankings, and identify whether the participant did better or worse during the higher ranked images. to analyse inhibition chapter better: One way to look at the effect of reward on compatibility effects is by looking at the proportion of correct comp trials when the target had the more positive valence rating, when the incomp had the more positive rating, etc. ;",15/01/2016,,
