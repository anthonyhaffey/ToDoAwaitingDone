"Ask Clare about inhibition task as a paper? in inhibition chapter, properly analyse whether reward value (Valence ratings), influences performance in the inhibition tasks. It appears that higher rated images have a lower RT for incomp trials than lower rated images in the simon task, but that accuracy in No-Go trials is worse for higher-rated images than lower rated images. Check ""Post-Thesis"" folder in Thesis; to look at the effect of valence on which images the participants performed best in during the Go/No-Go, compare the D-Prime scores for the two most used rankings, and identify whether the participant did better or worse during the higher ranked images. to analyse inhibition chapter better: One way to look at the effect of reward on compatibility effects is by looking at the proportion of correct comp trials when the target had the more positive valence rating, when the incomp had the more positive rating, etc. ;",15/01/16

These taxes wouldn't be managed at the state level, private companies could be allowed to classify which tax brand the advert goes into; BUT; the government would be able to fine the companies if they demonstrably fail to uphold the law. The companies can upload processed advert applications onto a government host. Any adverts that are NOT registered will definitely be fined. The question is whether this begins with television adverts; and then slowly extends to newspaper adverts etc. The good thing about this law would be that companies can't threaten to go abroad, the adverts in the country that they are displayed are taxed.",01/06/16
